                        <p>So the Gumiho is basically a fox that's lived for a thousand years and gained these amazing powers, including turning into a gorgeous woman. But there's always a catch with these things, right?</p >
                        <p>Apparently they need to eat human hearts to become fully human. It's kind of tragic when you think about it - they're stuck between two worlds, never quite belonging to either.</p >

                        <p>It's that classic horror story - something beautiful that turns out to be deadly. Reminds me of vampires or sirens from Western stories.</p >

                        <p>Dokkaebi are these funny creatures that form from old objects that have been around forever. They love playing tricks on people but they're not really evil.</p >
                        <p>What's cool is that they respect people who stand up to them. If you show courage, they might even help you out instead of just messing with you.</p >

                        <p>These are spirit attendants who forever look like beautiful children. They serve higher powers and are usually good, but there's something creepy about their eternal youth.</p >
                        <p>It's that feeling you get from porcelain dolls - beautiful but kind of unsettling because they never change or grow up.</p >
