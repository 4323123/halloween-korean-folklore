# Korean Ghost Stories

A simple website that explores some interesting Korean folklore spirits and how they connect with Halloween traditions. I built this for the BUILD Halloween Hacks 2025 event.

# What's this about?

I've always been curious about how different cultures imagine their supernatural beings. This project looks at three Korean spirits:

- **Gumiho** - the nine-tailed fox
- **Dokkaebi** - the mischievous goblin  
- **Dongja** - the eternal child spirits

Each has a unique story and some interesting parallels with Halloween monsters we're more familiar with.

# How it's built

Just the basics:
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling and animations
- JavaScript for interactive features

No fancy frameworks - wanted to keep it simple and lightweight.

# Features

- Smooth scroll animations
- Works on phones and computers
- Can navigate with keyboard
- Reading progress indicator
- Dark theme that fits the Halloween vibe

# Running locally

If you want to check out the code:
1. Download or clone the files
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. That's it - no build process or dependencies

# Note about images

Had some trouble getting images to load properly, so I ended up using CSS gradients and emojis instead. Sometimes constraints lead to creative solutions!
